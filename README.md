# Data 790: Python visualization
My final project for data 790 consists of a (heavily asterisked) analysis of the Rust contributor network via GitHub. I gathered data using a [scraper I wrote](https://github.com/joshuamegnauth54/git-github-graphs) in rather poor and unidiomatic Rust. I analyzed my data using NetworkX. I explain the caveats of my research in my paper which is available in this repository along with the LaTeX.

My code is available via the [viz_src](https://github.com/joshuamegnauth54/Data790_PyVis/tree/main/viz_src) folder. I reference several convenience functions written for my thesis. These functions are available [in my thesis repo](https://github.com/joshuamegnauth54/GamerDistributionThesis2020).

Both my paper and final project were accepted in December 2020. Any updates are to maintain the repo.
